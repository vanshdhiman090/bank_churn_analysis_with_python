## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a retail bank using machine learning techniques. Churn — when customers leave the bank — directly impacts profitability. By analyzing customer demographics, account information, and behavioral patterns, this project aims to identify the most influential features contributing to churn and build predictive models to assist in retention strategies.

# Dataset – The analysis is based on a dataset of 10,000 customers with features such as:
Age<br>
Gender<br>
Balance<br>
Credit Score<br>
Tenure<br>
Number of Products<br>
Geography<br>
Estimated Salary<br>
Churn Label (Exited/Stayed)<br>

# Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)<br>
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation & preprocessing<br>
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization<br>
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models & evaluation<br>
Imbalanced-learn – Handling class imbalance<br>

# Workflow

Data Exploration & Cleaning<br>
Checked missing values, duplicates, and outliers<br>
Handled categorical encoding and scaling<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
Visualized churn distribution and key customer features<br>
Identified relationships between churn and variables (e.g., age, balance, geography)<br>
Feature Engineering<br>
Encoded categorical features<br>
Normalized/standardized numerical features<br>

# Modeling
Trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)<br>
Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC<br>
Insights & Recommendations<br>
Highlighted most important features driving churn<br>
Suggested strategies for customer retention
